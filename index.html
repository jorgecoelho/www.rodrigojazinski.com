						<header class="major">
							<h2>I am a curious person at heart — drawn to how systems behave, how meaning emerges, and how people navigate complexity when the rules are unclear.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>That curiosity has consistently expressed itself through practice: understanding systems not only as technical artefacts, but as living arrangements of structure, uncertainty, and human judgment.</p>
						<p>Over the past 25 years, this has taken practical form through work in software engineering, product architecture, interactive media, healthcare, education, and research. I design and scale systems — technical, organisational, and conceptual — that must operate under real constraints, where clarity matters more than certainty.</p>
						<p><a href="https://www.jznsk.com" title="JZNSK LTD">Professionally</a>, I’ve worked with founders, CTOs, and leadership teams to translate vision into executable systems, supporting both delivery and decision-making in complex environments. Alongside this, my work as an executive coach focuses on helping individuals and teams develop clarity, presence, and coherence when pressure, ambiguity, and responsibility are unavoidable.</p>
						<p>In parallel, I lead an <a href="https://www.rdcj-research.com" title="RDCJ Research">independent research initiative</a> exploring symbolic systems, harmonic epistemology, and computational emergence — investigating how structure, resonance, and intention shape knowledge formation. This research began in the early 2000s through experimental work on media convergence and the digital economy, and is now formalised through publications, tools, and epistemic models that bridge technology, cognition, and culture.</p>

				<!-- Two: Systems Architect -->
					<section id="two">
						<h2>Systems Architect</h2>
						<p>I provide <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jazinski/" title="LinkedIn Experience" target="_blank">fractional CTO and systems-architecture support</a> to founders and high-growth teams navigating technical complexity. My focus is on platform scaling, resilient system design, and decision-making under uncertainty.</p>
						<p>I work closely with leadership teams to translate vision into executable systems — aligning architecture, delivery, and long-term adaptability. My approach is systems-first, but grounded in human awareness: designed for teams building real products who need clarity without rigidity.</p>
					</section>

				<!-- Three: Executive Coach -->
					<section id="three">
						<h2>Executive Coach</h2>
						<p>I work with founders, CTOs, and leadership teams to develop clarity, presence, and coherence while operating inside complex, high-pressure environments. <a href="https://www.jznsk.com/coach/Coaching_Approach_Rodrigo_Jazinski_2025-2026.pdf" target="_blank" title="Coaching Approach PDF">My coaching</a> focuses on vision alignment, delivery under real constraints, and the cultivation of emotionally intelligent organisational cultures.</p>
						<p>Whether navigating growth, transition, or uncertainty, I help individuals and teams slow down enough to think clearly, make grounded decisions, and move forward with intent.</p>
					</section>

				<!-- Four: Independent Researcher -->
					<section id="four">
						<h2>Independent Researcher</h2>
						<p>I lead an independent research initiative exploring symbolic systems, harmonic epistemology, and computational emergence. This work spans mathematics, <a href="https://www.wmoorchestra.com" target="_blank" title="WMO Orchestra">music theory</a>, cognition, and computation, investigating how meaning can be represented beyond traditional logical or purely data-driven approaches.</p>
						<p>The research bridges technology, culture, and epistemology, producing publications, conceptual tools, and models that examine how structure and intention shape the evolution of knowledge.</p>
