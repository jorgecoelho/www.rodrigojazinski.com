Systems Architect. Executive Coach. Independent Researcher.

I’m a systems-oriented technology leader with over 25 years of experience in software development, innovation, and strategic leadership across healthcare, media, education, and research. My background bridges engineering, interactive media, product architecture, and executive coaching.

From building digital platforms to guiding cross-functional teams, I’ve helped founders, CTOs, and organisations scale solutions and align vision with execution. As a leadership and executive coach, I support individuals and teams in navigating complexity with clarity, structure, and emotional presence.

In parallel, I lead an independent research initiative exploring symbolic systems, harmonic epistemology, and computational emergence—investigating how structure, resonance, and intention shape the evolution of knowledge. This research arc began in the early 2000s with experimental work on media convergence and the digital economy, and is now formalised through a dedicated programme of publication, tool development, and epistemic modelling.
